This versatile method allows for the exploration of various color combinations and layering effects. The linoleum block can be washed, enabling experimentation with different colours and the overlaying of multiple layers of the same print. This process provides artists with the flexibility to achieve nuanced and visually captivating results through the interplay of design, color, and layering. </p></div><div class="mb-6 text-sm md:text-base"><p class="font-text text-black"> In the creation of these prints, I initiated the process by digitally crafting a design, which was subsequently transferred onto the linoleum for printing. To introduce an element of experimentation and variation, I explored an alternative technique involving the application of ink on glass. The linoleum block was then pressed onto the inked glass surface, and subsequently, the glass was pressed onto the paper for printing. This unconventional method resulted in a distinctive reversal of the linocut design, producing a mirrored image compared to the traditional prints. This innovative approach not only added a layer of complexity to the series but also contributed to the richness and diversity of the overall artistic output. </p></div><div class="text-black text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>ILLUSTRATION &amp; LINOCUT</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+l+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+r+'"></div></div></div><div class="text-black text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>PRINTS</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+c+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+d+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+p+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+h+'"></div></div><div class="text-sm md:text-base"><p class="font-text text-black">The appealing moldy texture evident in the prints emerged as a result of the unique characteristics of the linoleum used in the process. The hardness and rough texture of the linoleum played a significant role, preventing the ink from distributing evenly across the surface. This uneven distribution, likely due to the linoleum&#39;s inherent texture, contributed to the creation of intriguing and organic patterns that resemble a moldy texture. Sometimes, unexpected outcomes like these can add an extra layer of visual interest and depth to the prints, turning what might be perceived as a challenge into a distinctive and aesthetically pleasing feature of the artistic work. </p></div></div>',6),_={__name:"LinoView",setup(v){return(f,g)=>(e(),i("main",null,[t(n),s("div",m,[u,t(o)])]))}};export{_ as default};
