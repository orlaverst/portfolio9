This technique can be amalgamated with various other printing methods to achieve distinct and individualised results. I find its versatility particularly appealing, allowing for both swift execution to generate numerous small and uncomplicated prints with minimal preparation, as well as a medium for meticulously printing designs that may entail months of intricate work. The adaptability of monotype offers a range of possibilities, making it a dynamic and expressive tool in the realm of printmaking, catering to a spectrum of artistic intentions and time investments. </p></div><div class="mb-6 text-sm md:text-base"><p class="font-text text-black">During the printing process, an intriguing idea emergedâ€”to create a small animation comprised of several frames using consecutive prints. I executed this by drawing plant imagery directly onto a piece of glass and printing from that surface. What I particularly appreciate about using glass as a printing base is the subtle diffusion that occurs when the paper is pressed onto it, introducing an unforeseen element. This phenomenon ensures that even with precise lines in the original design, each print captures a slightly different version, infusing an element of unpredictability. <br> For the initial animation, I utilised directly scanned images, maintaining a straightforward approach. In the subsequent animation, I took a different creative route by introducing gradient edits to the black elements. This alteration, coupled with additional animation frames, resulted in a dynamic and evolving visual narrative. The interplay of analog printing techniques, glass as a medium, and digital manipulation adds layers of complexity and spontaneity to the animated sequences. </p></div><div class="text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>FIRST PRINTS</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+d+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+c+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+m+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+p+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+u+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+g+'"></div></div><div class="pb-6"><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+f+'"></div></div><div class="text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>DIGITAL EDITING</p></div><div class="mb-2"><p class="font-text text-black">Following the completion of the initial animation, I felt compelled to explore the realm of colouring in my prints. Opting for a gradient approach, I aimed to introduce an additional dimension that would visually convey a sense of evolution within the artwork. This experimental choice not only added depth to the composition but also served as a dynamic element that subtly altered the aesthetic over the course of the animation. The integration of gradients into the printing process represents a deliberate creative choice, adding nuance and complexity to the visual narrative and demonstrating a commitment to pushing the boundaries of traditional printmaking techniques. </p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+h+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+v+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+_+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+n+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+x+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+b+'"></div></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+y+'"></div></div>',7),S={__name:"MonodrukView",setup(I){return(j,T)=>(i(),e("main",null,[t(l),a("div",w,[k,t(o)])]))}};export{S as default};
