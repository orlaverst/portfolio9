The inspiration for this design drew parallels to the kamishibai, a traditional form of Japanese street theatre and storytelling that gained popularity during the Great Depression of the 1930s and persisted until the mid-20th century with the advent of television. In the kamishibai tradition, wooden structures with paper panes adorned with drawings were employed, allowing the storyteller to reveal each drawing sequentially while narrating the corresponding portion of the story from the rear of the structure.
