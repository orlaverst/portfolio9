The careful selection of a font can significantly impact the visual identity of a project, setting the tone and influencing how it is perceived by the audience. Beyond considerations of mere legibility, fonts serve as a vehicle for expressing personality, mood, and theme, thereby contributing depth and nuance to the design. Whether opting for a contemporary sans-serif font, a classic serif with timeless appeal, or a distinctive script with playful undertones, each typeface introduces a unique visual language to the composition, rendering it an integral and strategic component of the design process. </p></div><div class="mb-6 text-sm md:text-base"><p class="font-text text-black"> Recognising the pivotal role of fonts in design, I endeavoured to create a bespoke typeface, a task that initially seemed daunting, given the absence of a starting point beyond an existing alphabet. Upon further investigation, I discovered the concept of modular fonts, where each letter or symbol is constructed from the same set of shapes. This revelation provided a structured approach to initiate the development of my own font, albeit one designed more for distinct characters rather than continuous text. <br> I named the resulting typeface &#39;Arthrosis&#39; after a perceptive observation made during a discussion with friends. One of them noted that the modular elements bore a resemblance to bones, a connection that became unmistakable upon closer examination. Following the creation of the font, I incorporated it into a poster design and featured it as a title in an exhibition, harnessing its distinctive and evocative qualities to enhance the visual impact of the respective projects. </p></div><div class="text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>FONT &amp; MODULAR ELEMENTS</p></div><div class=""><img class="maw-w-full h-auto" src="'+l+'"></div><div class="mb-6"><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Arthrosis, the font with in the right corner the 6 elements used to build each letter.</p></div></div><div class="text-sm md:text-base"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>USE</p></div><div class="pb-3 flex justify-center items-center"><img class="max-h-screen w-auto" src="'+n+'"></div><div class="mb-6"><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Additionally I created a poster with the font that I then printed with a riso printer. </p></div><div class="pb-3"><img class="maw-w-full h-auto" src="'+d+'"></div><div class=""><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Arthrosis used as the title font for another project in an expo. </p></div></div>',7),g={__name:"ArtroseView",setup(h){return(m,u)=>(e(),s("main",null,[t(r),i("div",p,[f,t(o)])]))}};export{g as default};
